# Apipoj Skills Resolver

Use `/spk:start` when the user has an outcome but does not know which workflow fits. Route directly when intent is already clear.

Rules:

1. Prefer one primary workflow.
2. Use a second workflow only when it supplies a required verification or approval gate.
3. State the actual effect level before crossing a write boundary.
4. Ask one material question at a time and include a recommended default.

<!-- SPK-COMMANDS:start -->
`typed only` = the agent cannot see it; you must type the command yourself.
